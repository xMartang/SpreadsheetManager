# SpreadsheetManager

My implementation for the spreadsheet manager task

## Assumptions

Here are all the assumptions I made and ended up in my implementation.
hopefully it still meets your requirements :)

1. The cell names are unique and cannot be empty, if they won't be unique the lookup function won't work properly.
2. Cell type ignores letter case.
